On the shop activity we have added a button to help you test easier that adds 500 points.

The actual way to get points is to start uploading your current position and stop uploading once
you reach your distance and points are determined based on fixed value + distance between when
you started uploading and stopped uploading to a max of 400 points

You are able to buy Icons which are variable in value. You have a collection that you can choose from
to set as your current avatar.

Every 500 points is a level. You start at level 0. There is also a progress bar that shows you
the percentage you need for the next level (visually).

The leaderboard has gold,bronze,silver cup for 1,2,3 respectively.
You can access the leaderboard by clicking on the leaderboard image on the Main Menu.

Permissions work based on Permissions button

Please note due to the testing feature of added Points we decided not to update the level of the
user on clicking the button unless of course the activity is reloaded.
